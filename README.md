The application parsing images of all kinds (screenshots / pictures / photos) from the site LightShot. 
The application generates random links and saves all the images in the program folder.

My ideas and intentions for the program are serious, so the next global update I plan to implement an algorithm for recognizing images according to specified parameters. 
For example, to select from them only "game content", or "confidential data" (login, password, mail, etc.), or "XXX", etc. 
I also want to expand the platform for parsing other popular sites, such as imgur. And other small additions of customizable parameters, the transition to a visual project and so on.

The application is analog prntscrScraper, but I want to expand and get better its functionality.
