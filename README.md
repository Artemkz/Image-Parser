# Image-Parser
Sorry for my bad english, i`m from Russia :)

The application parsing images of all kinds (screenshots / pictures / photos) from the site LightShot. 
The application generates random links and saves all the images in the program folder.

My ideas and intentions for the program are serious, so the next global update I plan to implement an algorithm for recognizing images according to specified parameters. 
For example, to select from them only "game content", or "confidential data" (login, password, mail, etc.), or "XXX", etc.
